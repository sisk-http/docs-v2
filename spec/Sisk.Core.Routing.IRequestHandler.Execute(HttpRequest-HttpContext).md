# Execute(HttpRequest, HttpContext) method

Declaring type: [Sisk.Core.Routing.IRequestHandler](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.IRequestHandler.md) (from Sisk.Core)


Definition:

```cs
HttpResponse? Execute(HttpRequest request, HttpContext context);
```

This method is called by the <a href="/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.Router.md">Router</a> before executing a request when the <a href="/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.Route.md">Route</a> instantiates an object that implements this interface.
