    https://md.proj.pw/sisk-http/docs-v2/<branch>


Overview of this repo branches:

- `main` hosts the markdown files for the documentation/manual files. These files can be manually edited by commit.
- `specification` hosts the markdown files for API specification. These files are not editable in this repository, but must be edited in the code repositories of each module.
- `spec-gen` maintains the utility code that generates the specification markdown files from the API documentation XML generated by msbuild.

## Contributing

Please contribute only to the `main` and `spec-gen` branches in this repository. If you want to contribute to the API documentation, edit the summary comment and send the pull request.

## Repository name

The name of this repository initially should have been just `docs`, but as a repository with this name already existed, it became `docs-v2`.

Changing the repository name would break all current documentation links, so we not going to do it. Let's stay with `docs-v2`.
